## GitHub Actions and Workflows

Github Actions enables you to create custom software development lifecycle workflows directly in your Github repository. These workflows are made out of different tasks so-called actions that can be run automatically on certain events.

This enables you to include Continues Integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) capabilities and many other features directly in your repository.

### Why care about Github Actions?
Before we get into the technical detail let's discussed why developers should care about Github Actions in the first place and which benefits they provide.

Github Actions is fully integrated into Github and therefore doesn't require and external site. This means that it can be managed in the same place as all your other repository related features like pull requests and issues.
Actions are completely free for every open-source repository and include 2000 free build minutes per month for all your private repositories which is comparable with most CI/CD free plans. If that is not enough for your needs you can pick another plan or go the self-hosted route.
