I am Vitalij, an overall IT enthusiast from the Czech Republic, currently working as IT Admin and helping with the creation of the best hardware crypto wallet.

I am very passionate about technology, running, gaming, watching TV shows, and also a bit of most IT-related stuff. In my free time, I also learn to develop in Swift and Python.
